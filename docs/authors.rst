`VPLanet` has been developed by a team of scientists with a broad range of
expertise. The following list give the names and contributions of all
developers.

**Rory Barnes** is the lead developer who conceived the project, implemented the
matrices and vectors of function pointers, designed the I/O scheme, and
maintains this repository. He also wrote most of the top-level files, such as
vplanet.h, control.c, etc. He also developed EqTide and RadHeat. He can be
reached at rory@astro.washington.edu.

**Russell Deitrick** developed the DistOrb, DistRot, GalHabit and POISE modules,
as well as VSPACE.

**Rodrigo Luger** developed the AtmEsc and STELLAR modules, as well as the
accompanying VPLOT resource. He also designed this repository, including setting
up the continuous integration and documentation.

**David Fleming** developed the BINARY module and has contributed to STELLAR,
AtmEsc, and EqTide. He also wrote the first version ofBigPlanet.

**Hayden Smotherman** developed SpiNBody and has contributed to various
subroutines that have significantly increased the efficiency of the executable.
He also added OpenMP functionality for multithreading.

**Peter Driscoll** developed the ThermInt module, contributed to RadHeat, and
connected them both to EqTide.

**Patrick Barth** developed the MagmOc module. He also assisted in AtmEsc
development.

**Laura Amaral** developed the FLARE module and contributed to AtmEsc.

**Thomas Quinn** assisted in the development of DistOrb, DistRot, and GalHabit.
He also found many bugs with valgrind and address-sanitizer.

**Caitlyn Wilhelm** added forced eccentricity and obliquity oscillations to
POISE, and assisted in debugging it. She also built the BigPlanet and
MultiPlanet scripts.

**Rodolfo Garcia** assisted in AtmEsc and ThermInt development.

**Ludmila Carone** assisted in the development of the MagmOc module.

**Billy Quarles** enabled POISE to read in previously computed orbital and rotational
data.

**Pramod Gupta** ported VPLanet to Windows 10.

**Diego McDonald** added the Lehmer-Catling model to AtmEsc.

**Benjamin Guyer** assisted in the coupling of EqTide and ThermInt.

**Lyan Guez** contributed to the development of the mpstatus script.
